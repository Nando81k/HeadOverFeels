# Setup Complete! ✅

## What I've Set Up For You

### 1. ✅ Environment Variable (`.env.local`)

Added secure random CRON_SECRET:
```bash
CRON_SECRET=LCBXgHfzlvyEndQTUfbOsaPdN7IsEPQX/7roA1Oo92A=
```

### 2. ✅ Vercel Cron Configuration (`vercel.json`)

Automatically schedules birthday points daily at midnight UTC:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/birthday-points",
    "schedule": "0 0 * * *"
  }]
}
```

### 3. ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/birthday-points-cron.yml`)

Alternative scheduling option if you prefer GitHub Actions.

### 4. ✅ Test Script (`scripts/test-birthday-cron.sh`)

Easy way to test locally:
```bash
./scripts/test-birthday-cron.sh
```

### 5. ✅ Complete Documentation (`docs/BIRTHDAY-CRON-SETUP.md`)

Full guide with deployment instructions, troubleshooting, and monitoring.

## 🎯 What Happens Next

**Every Day at Midnight UTC:**

1. Cron triggers `/api/cron/birthday-points`
2. System finds customers with birthdays today
3. Awards 50 points × tier multiplier to each
4. Creates transaction records
5. Logs results

**Example:**
- Customer at Head tier (1.0x): Gets 50 points
- Customer at Heart tier (1.25x): Gets 63 points  
- Customer at Overdrive tier (2.0x): Gets 100 points
