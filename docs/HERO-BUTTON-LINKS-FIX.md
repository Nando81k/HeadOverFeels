# Hero Button Links Fix

**Date**: October 26, 2024  
**Issue**: Hero section buttons linked to incorrect pages  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem

The two call-to-action buttons in the hero section were linking to the wrong destinations:
- "Shop Collection" button → `/products` (should go to `/collections`)
- "View Lookbook" button → `/collections` (should go to `/products`)

---

## Solution

Swapped the href values to match the expected navigation:

### Before
```tsx
<Button asChild size="lg">
  <Link href="/products">Shop Collection</Link>
</Button>
<Button asChild variant="outline" size="lg">
  <Link href="/collections">View Lookbook</Link>
</Button>
```

### After
```tsx
<Button asChild size="lg">
  <Link href="/collections">Shop Collection</Link>
</Button>
<Button asChild variant="outline" size="lg">
  <Link href="/products">View Lookbook</Link>
</Button>
```

## Changes

| Button Text | Before | After | Reasoning |
|-------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Shop Collection** | `/products` | `/collections` ✅ | "Collection" refers to curated product groups |
| **View Lookbook** | `/collections` | `/products` ✅ | "Lookbook" shows all available products |

---

## User Flow

### Shop Collection Button (Primary CTA)
- **Destination**: `/collections`
- **Purpose**: Browse curated collections of products
- **Style**: Solid button (primary action)
- **User Expectation**: See organized product categories/themes

### View Lookbook Button (Secondary CTA)
- **Destination**: `/products`
- **Purpose**: Browse all products (catalog view)
- **Style**: Outline button (secondary action)
- **User Expectation**: See complete product catalog

---

## File Modified

**File**: `/app/page.tsx`  
**Lines**: 141-145  
**Section**: Hero section CTA buttons

---

## Testing

- [x] "Shop Collection" button links to `/collections`
- [x] "View Lookbook" button links to `/products`
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Buttons maintain correct styling
- [x] Links work on click

## Impact

✅ **Improved Navigation**: Users reach expected destinations  
✅ **Better UX**: Button labels match page content  
✅ **Clearer Intent**: "Collection" and "Lookbook" now make sense semantically
