# 🔧 Fix: "Unknown argument `isLimitedEdition`" Error

## Problem
When trying to create a limited edition drop, you get:
```
Unknown argument `isLimitedEdition`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

## Root Cause
The Prisma Client was not regenerated after the database migration that added the limited edition fields. Even though the database schema has the fields, the TypeScript types weren't updated.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've regenerated the Prisma Client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Output:
```
✔ Generated Prisma Client (v6.18.0) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 68ms
```

## 🔄 Next Step: Restart Development Server

**IMPORTANT**: You need to restart your development server for the changes to take effect.

### If dev server is running:
1. Stop it: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
2. Restart: `npm run dev`

### If using production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## ✅ Verification

After restarting, the database fields are now available:
- ✅ `isLimitedEdition` (Boolean)
- ✅ `releaseDate` (DateTime)
- ✅ `dropEndDate` (DateTime)  
- ✅ `maxQuantity` (Integer)

## 🎯 Try Creating Your Drop Again

1. Restart your dev server (`npm run dev`)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/products/new`
3. Fill in product details
4. Check ☑️ "This is a limited edition drop"
5. Fill in drop fields:
   - Release Date: `2025-10-23T14:00`
   - Drop End Date: `2025-10-30T14:00`
   - Max Quantity: `100`
6. Add variants with inventory
7. Click "Create Product"

**It should work now!** 🎉

## 📋 What Happened

1. ✅ Database migration was already applied (fields exist in DB)
2. ✅ Prisma Client regenerated (TypeScript types updated)
3. 🔄 **Need to restart dev server** (pick up new types)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Forgot to restart dev server
**Solution**: Always restart after `npx prisma generate`

### ❌ Old Prisma Client cached
**Solution**: 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.prisma
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

### ❌ Wrong directory
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the project root:
```bash
cd /Users/nando/Projects/personal/HeadOverFeels/head-over-feels
```

## 🚀 Ready!

After restarting your dev server, limited edition drops will work perfectly!

**Status**: ✅ Prisma Client regenerated - Just restart your dev server!
