# Email Notification System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Phase 3 of the Head Over Feels platform is complete! The email notification system automatically sends professional, branded emails to customers for order confirmations and shipping notifications using Resend and React Email.

## What Was Built

### 1. Email Templates (`/emails/`)
- **OrderConfirmation.tsx** - Beautiful order confirmation email with:
  - Order number and customer name
  - Itemized product list with variants and pricing
  - Price breakdown (subtotal, shipping, tax, total)
  - Shipping address
  - Support contact information
  
- **ShippingNotification.tsx** - Shipping notification email with:
  - Prominent tracking number display
  - Shipping method information
  - Automatic tracking URL generation for USPS, UPS, FedEx
  - "Track Your Package" button with carrier link
  - Order number reference

### 2. Email Utility Functions (`/lib/email/resend.ts`)
- **sendOrderConfirmation()** - Sends order confirmation emails
  - Accepts order data and renders email template
  - Sends via Resend API
  - Error handling with logging
  
- **sendShippingNotification()** - Sends shipping notification emails
  - Accepts tracking information and renders email template
  - Sends via Resend API
  - Error handling with logging

### 3. Webhook Integration (`/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)
- **Order Confirmation Trigger**: When `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook fires:
  1. Updates order status to `CONFIRMED` and payment status to `PAID`
  2. Fetches order with items, products, variants, and shipping address
  3. Sends order confirmation email to customer
  4. Logs success/failure but doesn't block webhook processing

### 4. Order API Integration (`/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`)
- **Shipping Notification Trigger**: When order status changes to `SHIPPED`:
  1. Checks if status changed from non-SHIPPED to SHIPPED
  2. Verifies tracking number exists
  3. Sends shipping notification email to customer
  4. Logs success/failure but doesn't block API request

## Packages Installed
```bash
npm install resend react-email @react-email/components
# Added 131 packages, total: 556 packages, 0 vulnerabilities
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:

```env
# Resend API Key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Email Sender Address (optional, defaults provided)
EMAIL_FROM=Head Over Feels <orders@headoverfeels.com>
```

### Get Resend API Key
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Order Confirmation Email

**Requirements:**
- Resend API key configured
- Development server running
- Stripe webhook configured (or simulate webhook)

**Steps:**
1. Create test order through checkout flow
2. Complete payment with Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Stripe will trigger webhook to `/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Check console logs for: `"Order confirmation email sent for order {orderId}"`
5. Check Resend dashboard for sent email
6. Check customer email inbox

**Expected Result:**
- Order confirmation email received with:
  - Correct order number
  - Customer name
  - All order items with variants
  - Accurate pricing breakdown
  - Shipping address
  
**Test Without Stripe (Manual):**
```typescript
// Create a test endpoint /api/test/send-email
import { sendOrderConfirmation } from '@/lib/email/resend'

await sendOrderConfirmation({
  to: 'test@example.com',
  orderNumber: 'TEST-001',
  customerName: 'John Doe',
  items: [
    {
      productName: 'Oversized Hoodie',
      variantDetails: 'Size: XL, Color: Black',
      quantity: 1,
      price: 89.99
    }
  ],
  subtotal: 89.99,
  shipping: 10.00,
  tax: 8.00,
  total: 107.99,
  shippingAddress: {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    addressLine1: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Los Angeles',
    state: 'CA',
    zipCode: '90001',
  },
})
```

### 2. Test Shipping Notification Email

**Requirements:**
- Resend API key configured
- Admin access to order management
- Existing paid order in database

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/admin/orders`
2. Click on an order with status `CONFIRMED` or `PROCESSING`
3. In the update form:
   - Change Status to `SHIPPED`
   - Add Tracking Number (e.g., `1Z999AA10123456784`)
   - Select Shipping Method (e.g., `UPS Ground`)
4. Click "Update Order"
5. Check console logs for: `"Shipping notification sent for order {orderId}"`
6. Check Resend dashboard for sent email
7. Check customer email inbox

**Expected Result:**
- Shipping notification email received with:
  - Correct order number
  - Customer name
  - Tracking number in monospace font
  - Shipping method
  - Working "Track Your Package" button
  - Correct tracking URL for carrier

**Test Tracking URL Generation:**
- USPS tracking: `https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?tLabels={trackingNumber}`
- UPS tracking: `https://www.ups.com/track?tracknum={trackingNumber}`
- FedEx tracking: `https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?tracknumbers={trackingNumber}`

### 3. Test Error Handling

**Test Email Failure (No API Key):**
1. Remove `RESEND_API_KEY` from `.env.local`
2. Trigger order confirmation or shipping notification
3. Check console logs for error message
4. Verify webhook/API request still completes successfully
5. Order should still be updated despite email failure

**Expected Behavior:**
- Error logged: `"Failed to send order confirmation email..."`
- Webhook returns `200 OK` (doesn't block)
- API request returns `200 OK` with updated order
- Email sending failures don't break core functionality

## Email Template Customization

### Modify Email Styling
Edit inline styles in `/emails/OrderConfirmation.tsx` or `/emails/ShippingNotification.tsx`:

```typescript
const main = {
  backgroundColor: '#f6f9fc',  // Change background color
  fontFamily: '-apple-system,...',  // Change font
}

const h1 = {
  color: '#000000',  // Change heading color
  fontSize: '32px',  // Change heading size
}

const button = {
  backgroundColor: '#000000',  // Change button color
  color: '#ffffff',  // Change button text color
}
```

### Add Custom Branding
Replace "Head Over Feels" text:
```tsx
<Heading style={h1}>Your Brand Name</Heading>
<Text style={tagline}>Your Tagline</Text>
```

Add logo (requires public URL):
```tsx
import { Img } from '@react-email/components'

<Img 
  src="https://yoursite.com/logo.png" 
  alt="Your Brand"
  width="150"
  height="50"
/>
```

### Preview Email Templates Locally
React Email provides development preview:

```bash
# Install React Email CLI globally
npm install -g react-email

# Run email preview server
cd emails/
react-email dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 to preview templates
```

## Production Checklist

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Verify domain in Resend
- [ ] Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC DNS records
- [ ] Update `EMAIL_FROM` to verified domain
- [ ] Test all email templates with real data
- [ ] Verify tracking URLs work for all carriers
- [ ] Test email rendering in multiple clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- [ ] Set up email monitoring/alerts in Resend dashboard
- [ ] Review Resend sending limits for your plan

### Domain Verification
1. Resend Dashboard → Domains → Add Domain
2. Copy DNS records:
   - SPF: `v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all`
   - DKIM: (provided by Resend)
   - DMARC: `v=DMARC1; p=none;`
3. Add records to DNS provider
4. Wait for verification (can take 24-48 hours)
5. Test sending from verified domain

### Email Deliverability Best Practices
- Use verified domain (not free email providers)
- Keep email size under 100KB
- Avoid spam trigger words in subject/body
- Include physical mailing address in footer
- Provide unsubscribe link for marketing emails
- Monitor bounce/complaint rates in Resend dashboard
- Warm up new sending domain gradually

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
**Issue**: No email received, no errors in logs

**Solutions**:
1. Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Verify API key is active in Resend dashboard
3. Check Resend dashboard for rejected/bounced emails
4. Verify recipient email is valid
5. Check spam/junk folder
6. Review Resend sending limits

### Email Sending But Not Received
**Issue**: Logs show success but email not in inbox

**Solutions**:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
4. Review email client's filtering rules
5. Test with different email provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)

### Tracking URL Not Working
**Issue**: Tracking link leads to 404 or error page

**Solutions**:
1. Verify tracking number format is correct
2. Check shipping method string matches carrier
3. Manually construct tracking URL and test
4. Provide custom `trackingUrl` parameter if needed:
   ```typescript
   await sendShippingNotification({
     // ...other params
     trackingUrl: 'https://custom-tracking-url.com/track/12345',
   })
   ```

### TypeScript Errors in Email Templates
**Issue**: `Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'x'`

**Solution**: Add `as const` to CSS property values:
```typescript
const style = {
  fontWeight: 'bold' as const,
  textAlign: 'center' as const,
}
```

### Webhook Not Triggering Emails
**Issue**: Payment succeeds but no email sent

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook signature verification passes
2. Check `orderId` exists in `paymentIntent.metadata`
3. Verify order exists in database
4. Check console logs for errors
5. Test webhook with Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
   stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
   ```
