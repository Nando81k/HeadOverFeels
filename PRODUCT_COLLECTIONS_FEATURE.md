# Product Collections Management - Feature Complete

## üéâ What's Been Implemented

### Collection Assignment from Product Edit Page ‚úÖ

You can now add existing products to collections directly from the product edit page at `/admin/products/[id]`.

## üìã Features

### 1. **Collections Section in Product Edit Page**
- New "Collections" card between "Status" and "Limited Edition Drop" sections
- Multi-select checkboxes showing all available collections
- Select/deselect collections to add/remove products
- Clear feedback showing which collections the product belongs to

### 2. **Automatic Collection Loading**
- All collections are loaded when the page opens
- Current collection assignments are automatically selected
- No manual refresh needed

### 3. **Collection Association Management**
- Save button updates both product data and collection associations
- Properly handles adding/removing products from multiple collections
- Maintains collection sort order

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**Frontend:**
- `/app/admin/products/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Added `Collection` interface
  - Added `collections` state for available collections
  - Added `selectedCollections` state for tracking selected collection IDs
  - Added `useEffect` to fetch all collections on load
  - Added Collections UI section with checkboxes
  - Updated `handleSubmit` to include `collectionIds` in API request
  - Updated `Product` interface to include `collections` field

**Backend:**
- `/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`
  - Updated `updateProductSchema` to accept `collectionIds` array
  - Modified GET endpoint to include collection associations
  - Modified PUT endpoint to:
    - Extract `collectionIds` from request body
    - Use transaction to update product and collections atomically
    - Delete existing collection associations
    - Create new collection associations with proper sort order
    - Return updated product with collection data

## üîÑ How It Works

### Database Structure
```
Product (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (Many) CollectionProduct (Many) ‚Üê‚Üí (1) Collection
```

The `CollectionProduct` join table stores:
- `productId` - Reference to the product
- `collectionId` - Reference to the collection
- `sortOrder` - Position in the collection (0-based)

### Update Flow
1. User opens product edit page
2. System fetches product data including current collection IDs
3. System fetches all available collections
4. User checks/unchecks collection checkboxes
5. User clicks "Update Product"
6. API receives `collectionIds` array
7. Transaction starts:
   - Delete all existing `CollectionProduct` records for this product
   - Create new `CollectionProduct` records for selected collections
   - Update product data
   - Commit transaction
8. Product page refreshes to show updated data

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Adding Products to Collections

1. Navigate to `/admin/products`
2. Click on a product to edit
3. Scroll to the "Collections" section

### Managing Multiple Collections

You can add a product to multiple collections at once:

- The product will appear in all selected collections
- Each collection can have its own sort order (currently based on addition order)
